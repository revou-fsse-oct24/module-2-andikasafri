### üñã Assignment Implementation Summary

This section covers all assignment tasks, demonstrating the implementation of various required features:

- **Font Implementation**: Custom `@font-face` font applied to the `body` element for consistent usability across the site.
- **Text Styling**: `text-shadow` applied to `.title` and `.work-wrapper h3` for subtle, polished effects.
- **Custom List Styles**: Unique list styles created using emojis with the `::before` pseudo-element on various `ul` lists.
- **Responsive Background Image**:
  - Uses the `<picture>` element with multiple `<source>` tags and `srcset` attributes to serve optimized images based on screen width.
  - Includes fallback `<img>` for compatibility with older browsers.
  - `object-fit: cover` ensures aspect ratio maintenance.
  - Example:
    ```html
    <picture class="background-image">
      <source
        media="(max-width: 767px)"
        srcset="../images/about-bg-small.webp"
      />
      <source
        media="(max-width: 1199px)"
        srcset="../images/about-bg-medium.webp"
      />
      <source
        media="(min-width: 1200px)"
        srcset="../images/about-bg-large.webp"
      />
      <img src="../images/about-bg-fallback.webp" alt="About background" />
    </picture>
    ```
- **Asymmetrical Grid Layout**: Uses CSS Grid for an asymmetrical layout in the work experience section, with media queries for responsiveness.
- **CSS Transitions**:
  - Example: `.tm-view-more-btn` with `transition: all 0.6s ease-in;`
- **CSS Animations**:
  - Example: `@keyframes slideInFromLeft` to create a slide-in effect:
    ```css
    @keyframes slideInFromLeft {
      0% {
        transform: translateX(-100%);
        opacity: 0;
      }
      100% {
        transform: translateX(0);
        opacity: 1;
      }
    }
    ```
